description: Combining Blocks together to create a starting repository template configuration.
title: Presets
---

A _Preset_ defines a group of [Blocks](/engines/stratum/concepts/blocks) that can be put together to form a repository base.
Each Preset includes a `blocks` array consisting of Blocks generated by the same parent [Base](/engines/stratum/concepts/bases).

For example, this Preset combines two of the blocks from [Blocks](/engines/stratum/concepts/blocks):

```ts
import { base } from "./base";
import { blockNvmrc } from "./blockNvmrc";
import { blockREADME } from "./blockREADME";

export const presetExampleBlocks = base.createPreset({
	about: {
		name: "Example",
	},
	blocks: [blockNvmrc, blockREADME],
});
```

A template running with that preset would create both an `.nvmrc` file and a `README.md` file.
