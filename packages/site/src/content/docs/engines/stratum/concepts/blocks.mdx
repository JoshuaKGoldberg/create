title: Blocks
---

A _Block_ defines the logic to create a portion of a repository.
Each Block is associated with a parent [Base](/engines/stratum/concepts/bases).
Blocks can then be listed in [Presets](/engines/stratum/concepts/presets) associated with the same Base.

Blocks can be individually added and removed by users when customizing their repository.

:::tip
Block properties are a subset of those available in [`createTemplate`](/build/apis/create-template).
Any properties with the same name will behave similarly during production.
:::

## Production

Blocks define their logic for created repository portions in a `produce()` function.
`produce()` returns a [Creation](/build/concepts/creations) describing any produced output.

When `create` scaffolds a repository from a Preset, it merges together the produced outputs from its listed Blocks.

For example, this Block describes creating a `.nvmrc` file:

```ts
import { base } from "./base";

export const blockNvmrc = base.createBlock({
	produce() {
		return {
			files: {
				".nvmrc": "20.12.2",
			},
		};
	},
});
```

That `blockNvmrc` can then be listed in a [Preset](/engines/stratum/concepts/presets)'s `blocks` array:

```ts
import { base } from "./base";
import { blockNvmrc } from "./blockNvmrc";

export const presetVersioned = base.createPreset({
	blocks: [
		blockNvmrc,
		// ...
	],
});
```

That `presetVersioned` would then produce an `.nvmrc` file with text content `20.12.2` when run.

```yml title=".nvmrc"
20.12.2
```

## Options

Each Block runs with the options defined by its parent [Base](/engines/stratum/concepts/bases).

For example, a Base with a `name` option could create a Block that generates part of a `README.md` file:

```ts
import { base } from "./base";

export const blockREADME = base.createBlock({
	produce({ options }) {
		return {
			files: {
				"README.md": `# ${options.name}`,
			},
		};
	},
});
```

If `create` is run with `--name My Repository`, a `README.md` would be generated with that as its heading:

```md title="README.md"
# My Repository
```

## Addons

Blocks can define additional optional data called _"Addons"_ that they can be receive from other Blocks.
Blocks define Addons as the properties for a [Zod](https://zod.dev) object schema and then receive them in their context.

For example, this Block takes in a string array under a `names` Addon, to be printed in a `names.txt` file:

```ts
import { z } from "zod";

import { base } from "./base";

export const blockNames = base.createBlock({
	addons: {
		names: z.array(z.string()).default([]),
	},
	async produce({ addons }) {
		return {
			files: {
				"names.txt": addons.names.join("\n"),
			},
		};
	},
});
```

Other Blocks may produce Addons to be given to any other Blocks.
These Addons will be merged together when a Preset containing the Blocks is run.

For example, the following Names Block receives composed Addons from the FruitNames Block:

```ts
import { z } from "zod";

import { base } from "./base";

export const blockNames = base.createBlock({
	addons: {
		names: z.array(z.string()).default([]),
	},
	async produce({ addons }) {
		return {
			files: {
				"names.txt": addons.names.join("\n"),
			},
		};
	},
});

export const blockFruitNames = base.createBlock({
	async produce() {
		return {
			addons: [
				blockNames({
					names: ["apple", "banana", "cherry"],
				}),
			],
		};
	},
});
```

A Preset containing both Blocks would then produce a `names.txt` file with those three names as lines in its text:

```plaintext
// names.txt
apple
banana
cherry
```

### Merging

At runtime, the `create` engine will often need to re-run Blocks continuously as they receive Addons from other Blocks.
Blocks will be re-run whenever other Blocks signal new Addon data to them that they haven't yet seen.
This allows Blocks to not need any explicit indication of what order to run in.

Addons are merged by concatenating arrays and removing duplicate elements.
Duplicates are detected by [`hash-object`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hash-object) object hashing.

For example, given the following two Addons to be merged:

```ts
[
	{ name: "First", steps: ["a", "b"] },
	{ name: "Second", steps: ["c", "d"] },
];
```

```ts
[
	{ name: "Second", steps: ["c", "d"] },
	{ name: "Third", steps: ["e", "f"] },
],
```

The merged result would be:

```ts
[
	{ name: "First", steps: ["a", "b"] },
	{ name: "Second", steps: ["c", "d"] },
	{ name: "Third", steps: ["e", "f"] },
];
```
