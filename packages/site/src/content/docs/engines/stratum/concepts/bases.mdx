description: The "Base" object used to create Blocks and Presets.
title: Bases
---

A _Base_ defines an object of option types and default values that will be used to scaffold a repository.
Bases are used to generate [Blocks](/engines/stratum/concepts/blocks) and [Presets](/engines/stratum/concepts/presets) that rely on user-specified values for those options.

:::tip
Base properties are a subset of those available in [`createTemplate`](/build/apis/create-template).
Any properties with the same name will behave similarly during production.
:::

## Options

Each Base is associated with a set of options represented by [Zod](https://zod.dev) schemas.
Each property of those options represents a configurable value that can be provided by a user.
Those options carry through to Blocks and Presets associated with the base.

For example, this minimal Base stores only a `name` string:

```ts
import { createBase } from "bingo-stratum";
import { z } from "zod";

export const base = createBase({
	options: {
		name: z.string(),
	},
});
```

Blocks and Presets made with that `base` will have access to the `name` option of type `string`.

> `options` on a Base works the same as [`createTemplate` > `options`](/build/apis/create-template#options).

### Disallowed Option Names

The only option name that may not be used is `preset`.
That option is set automatically per [Templates > Options](/engines/stratum/concepts/templates#options).

## Preparation

Bases can optionally define a `prepare()` function that provides default fallback values for options.

For example, this Base defaults its `value` option to `"default"` if not provided:

```ts
import { createBase } from "bingo-stratum";
import { z } from "zod";

export const base = createBase({
	options: {
		value: z.string().optional(),
	},
	prepare() {
		return {
			value: "default",
		};
	},
});
```
