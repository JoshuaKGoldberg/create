## Where does the name _"Stratum"_ come from?

_"Stratum"_ refers to a layer or level in a structured system, such as geological strata or organizational layers.
That's thematically tied to how the engine works:

- [Bases](/engines/stratum/concepts/bases) form the underlying base layer upon which other layers are built
- [Blocks](/engines/stratum/concepts/blocks) make available individual pieces of structure
- [Presets](/engines/stratum/concepts/presets) group together structures into usable layers of tooling

It also looks and sounds sophisticated.
_"Stratum"_.

## Why can't we define Addons for Blocks in Presets?

In other words, you might be wondering why the API doesn't allow something like this:

```js
export const presetExample = base.createPreset({
	blocks: [
		myBlock({
			someArg: "...",
		}),
	],
});
```

This is because Blocks shouldn't need to be configured.
Users should be able to turn them off and on at will without any configuration.

Passing Addons to a Block in a Preset means users will have no way to override or remove those Addons.
