description: The expanded set of creations that can be produced by Stratum Blocks.
title: Stratum Block Creations
---

Recap: [Bingo creations](/build/concepts/creations) may specify two areas of repositories:

- ["Direct" creations](/build/concepts/creations#direct-creations): that always cause changes to the repository
- ["Indirect" creations](/build/concepts/creations#indirect-creations): to hint to the Bingo CLI

[Block Productions](/engines/stratum/concepts/blocks) may produce any properties from standard Bingo creations.
They may also produce a new `addons` property to signal inputs to other Blocks.

### `addons`

Any [Block Addons](/engines/stratum/concepts/blocks#addons) to signal should be factored into the created repository.

For example, given the following `blockGitignore` with an `ignores` Addon, a `blockTypeScript` could signal to ignore the `/lib` directory:

```ts
import { z } from "zod";

import { base } from "./base";

export const blockGitignore = base.createBlock({
	addons: {
		ignores: z.array(z.string()).default([]),
	},
	produce({ addons }) {
		return {
			files: {
				".gitignore": [...addons.ignores, "/node_modules"].join("\n"),
			},
		};
	},
});

export const blockTypeScript = base.createBlock({
	produce() {
		return {
			addons: [
				blockGitignore({
					ignores: ["/lib"],
				}),
			],
			files: {
				"tsconfig.json": JSON.stringify({
					compilerOptions: {
						outDir: "lib",
						strict: true,
					},
				}),
			},
		};
	},
});
```

Producing a template with those two Blocks would result in a `.gitignore` with two ignored directories:

```plaintext title=".gitignore"
/lib
/node_modules
```
