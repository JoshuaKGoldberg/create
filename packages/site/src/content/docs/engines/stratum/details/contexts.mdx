title: Stratum Contexts
---

Some Stratum constructs reuse the same contexts as described in [Details > Contexts](/build/details/contexts):

- [Bases](/engines/stratum/concepts/bases) receive an [Options Context](/build/details/contexts#options-contexts)
- [Templates](/engines/stratum/concepts/templates) receive a [Template Context](/build/details/contexts#template-contexts) with `settings` described in [Stratum Template Configurations](/engines/stratum/details/configurations)

Other Stratum constructs do not reuse Bingo's existing contexts:

- [Blocks](/engines/stratum/concepts/blocks) receive a [Block Context](#block-contexts)
- [Presets](/engines/stratum/concepts/presets) don't have their own contexts

## Block Contexts

The Context object provided to the `produce` object of [Blocks](/engines/stratum/concepts/blocks).

### `addons`

Any [Block Addons](/engines/stratum/concepts/blocks#addons) that have been provided by other Blocks.

For example, this Gitignore Block defines an `ignores` Addon that other Blocks can use to add to its created `.gitignore` file:

```ts
import { base } from "./base";

export const blockGitignore = base.createBlock({
	addons: {
		ignores: z.array(z.string()).default([]),
	},
	produce({ addons }) {
		return {
			files: {
				".gitignore": ["/node_modules", ...addons.ignores].join("\n"),
			},
		};
	},
});
```

### `options` {#block-options}

User-provided values as described by the parent [Base](/engines/stratum/concepts/bases).

Bases fill in option values before running Blocks.
Each Block created by a Base will run with the same set of options.

For example, this Base defines a `repository` option, which the Block then prints as a `package.json` property:

```ts
import { createBase } from "create";

export const base = createBase({
	options: {
		repository: z.string(),
	},
});

export const blockPackageJson = createBlock({
	produce({ options }) {
		return {
			files: {
				"package.json": JSON.stringify({ name: options.repository }),
			},
		};
	},
});
```
