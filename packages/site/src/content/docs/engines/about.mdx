:::note
These docs assume you've read [Building Templates](/build/about) first.

A single `produce()` function generally doesn't scale well beyond small straightforward repositories.
Templates generally end up using one or more template systems for defining files.

Bingo maintains two first-party templates:

1. **[Handlebars](/engines/handlebars/about)**: allows defining files as [handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com) templates.
   Generally recommended for straightforward templates that have more than a half dozen files.
2. **[Stratum](/engines/stratum/about)**: a rich system to define each feature of a template as an independent "Blocks".
   Recommended for templates that want to allow rich logic and/or multiple starting presets.
