title: Modes
---

The Bingo engine can optionally be told to run in one the following "modes":

- `"setup"`: Indicating the production is being used to create a new repository
- `"transition"`: Indicating the production is migrating an existing repository

Running the `bingo` CLI will always infer one of the modes.
The [`produceTemplate`](/build/apis/produce-template) and [`runTemplate`](/build/apis/run-template) may optionally specify a mode.

## Setup

This mode creates a new repository on GitHub.

As the production is run, the Bingo engine will add in additional creations from the template's [`setup()` function](/build/apis/create-template#transition), if it exists.
Those creations typically includes example starter files or one-time API registrations.

When running Bingo in setup mode, it will:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub
   - If the template defines an [`about.repository`](/build/apis/create-template#about), the repository will include a _generated from_ notice pointing to that template repository
2. Run the template's producer function
3. Add that new repository as the `origin` remote
4. Apply the template's creations to the repository
5. Force-push a single commit with the new repository contents to that origin

## Transition

This mode migrates an existing repository onto the provided template.

As the production is run, the Bingo engine will add in additional creations from the template's [`transition()` function](/build/apis/create-template#transition), if it exists.
Those creations typically includes scripts that delete files from known no-longer-used pieces of tooling.

When running Bingo on the CLI in transition mode, it will:

1. Check if the repository is freshly cloned from the template's [GitHub template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
   - If it is, remove all local files and Git history
2. Run the template's producer function
   - If this was a fresh template repository clone, create and push an initial commit
3. Apply the template's creations to the repository
