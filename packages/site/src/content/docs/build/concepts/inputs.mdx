title: Inputs

An _Input_ is how template options can use external resources such as the file system.
Each input defines:

- Any number of arguments that it takes in
- A production method that reads from system resources

Inputs are created using [APIs > `createInput()`](/build/apis/create-input).

For example, this Input defines a required `path` string to read from a file on disk:

```ts
import { createInput } from "bingo";
import { z } from "zod";

export const inputFromFile = createInput({
	args: {
		path: z.string(),
	},
	async produce({ args, fs }) {
		return await fs.readFile(args.path);
	},
});
```

Using `take` and Inputs to access external resources allows for straightforward mocking of those resources during unit tests.
See [Templating FAQs > Why should we use `take` and Inputs in `prepare()`?](/build/faqs#why-should-we-use-take-and-inputs-in-prepare).

## Provided Inputs

Bingo manages a small set of commonly useful Inputs:

- [`input-from-fetch`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/input-from-fetch): Sends a network request
- [`input-from-file`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/input-from-file): Reads a file's contents as text
- [`input-from-file-json`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/input-from-file-json): Parse's a file's text contexts with `JSON.parse`
- [`input-from-script`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/input-from-script): Runs a script command

See those individual packages for their documentation.
