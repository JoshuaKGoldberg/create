## Engines

### What should I do if my template has many files and/or options?

> Or: how do I scale the template's `produce()` function?

It depends on how many files and/or options your template includes.
In increasing order of scale:

1. If your template produces fewer than ~10 files, consider keeping them all inline in `produce()`
2. Up to around ~20 files, consider splitting helper functions out for `produce()`'s readabability
3. After ~20 files, consider onboarding to one of the [Templating Engines](/engines/about):
   1. If there are many files but not many options, consider the [Handlebars engine](/engines/handlebars/about)
   2. If there are many files and many options, consider the [Stratum engine](/engines/stratum/about)

If you're writing your first template, it's recommended to go through that list in order.
Start small and learn Bingo on its own before moving up to a more rich templating engine.

## Options

### Why are options defined as an object with Zod schemas as properties, not a Zod object schema itself?

> Or: why not allow non-object types for options schemas, such as the following `z.union()`?

```ts
import { createTemplate } from "bingo";

export default createTemplate({
	about: { name: "My Template" },
	options: z.union([
		z.object({ a: z.string(), b: z.number() }),
		z.object({ c: z.number(), d: z.string() }),
	]),
	produce({ options }) {
		// ...
	},
});
```

Template options are converted to CLI flags before templates are run.
Having the Bingo CLI map from complex conditional Zod types to CLI flags is a difficult task.
Soon, Bingo-specific tooling will be able to describe full documentation websites that will also need to parse CLI flags.

Conditional CLI flags are also more confusing for users.
Having to understand union types or other concepts to know which flags are available adds cognitive burden to using a template.

Instead of describing a schema as a complex type itself, consider moving the complex type to a property of the options object:

```ts
import { createTemplate } from "bingo";

export default createTemplate({
	about: { name: "My Template" },
	options: {
		letters: z.union([
			z.object({ a: z.string(), b: z.number() }),
			z.object({ c: z.number(), d: z.string() }),
		]),
	},
	produce({ options }) {
		// ...
	},
});
```

If you have a use case for root-level flags that shouldn't be made into an options object property, please [file a feature request issue on Bingo](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/bingo/issues/new?template=03-feature.yml).

### Why do templates define a separate `prepare()`, not Zod methods like `refine` or `transform`?

Bingo intentionally does not use any Zod features beyond creating and describing schemas.
This is for two reasons:

- Bases often need data to be shared between multiple -even many- different Options.
  Loading implementations become much cleaner when all data loaders can be declared once in a `prepare()` function,
  wrapped in a caching [`lazyValue`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/lazy-value), then used as needed across any number of Options.
- Long-term, the engine should not be locked into any one schema engine.
  Adopting Zod-specific features will make it harder to swap between other implementers of [standard-schema](https://github.com/standard-schema/standard-schema) in the future if needed.

See the [`create-example` Base `prepare()` implementation](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/bingo-example/blob/c6714eeb02a5106eb5e4e4694f1e8b590444030d/src/base.ts#L138) (TODO: FIX LINK once it exists ðŸ˜„) for an example of values used across Options.

### Why is the template `prepare()` function synchronous?

> Or: why must options defaults be provided as asynchronous functions, rather than having `prepare()` itself `await` for their values?

Option values might be provided by the user.
When an option is provided via an explicit CLI flag or in a producer API, its default logic shouldn't be awaited.

If a user provides explicit values for all options then the `prepare()` function should take as little time as possible: i.e. it should be synchronous.

### Why should we use `take` and Inputs in `prepare()`?

> Or: why not directly call to `fetch()`, `fs.readFile`, and other external resource APIs in [`createTemplate` > `prepare()`](/build/apis/create-template#asynchronous-defaults)?

You can certainly use those APIs in your `prepare()` functions.
However, mocking out resources during unit testing is much harder if you do.

[`bingo-testers`](/build/packages/bingo-testers) functions allow injecting mock versions of [context properties](/build/details/contexts).
They will also throw an error if you accidentally call to a context property without providing a mock function for it.
This can prevent accidental file writes, network calls, and script commands when running unit tests.

See [Packages > `bingo-systems`](/build/packages/bingo-systems) for documentation on the system call wrappers.

### Why is the `prepareOptions()` API not a part of `produceTemplate()` or `runTemplate()`?

Not every caller of [`produceTemplate()`](/build/apis/produce-template) or [`runTemplate()`](/build/apis/run-template) may want to asynchronously load in options.
Some callers might have separately loaded in all required options, and not want to allow any to run their defaults logic.

## Productions

### Can `produce()`, `setup()`, or `transition()` run asynchronously?

> Or: why are these methods synchronous?

Any information that you would want to read asynchronously should be taken in as options.
Options allow defining important intake information with well-typed Zod schemas and `prepare()` logic to efficiently infer default values.

If you have a use case for information that should be asynchronously loaded but cannot be an option, please [file a feature request issue on Bingo](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/bingo/issues/new?template=03-feature.yml).

### How should I make all file creations formatted consistently?

> Or: is there a way to run a formatter such as [Prettier](https://prettier.io) on all created files?

The recommended approach is to have a [`scripts` creation](/build/concepts/creations#scripts) run the formatter in the same way the created repository will.
If you want your files to be formatted consistently, chances are your users will as well.

This template sets up Prettier and includes a script creation to run it after creating files:

```ts
import { format } from "@prettier/sync";
import { createTemplate } from "bingo";

export default createTemplate({
	about: { name: "My Template" },
	produce() {
		return {
			files: {
				"README.md": `# Hello, world!`,
				"index.js": `console.log("Hello, world!");`,
				"package.json": JSON.stringify({
					devDependencies: {
						prettier: "3",
					},
					scripts: {
						format: "prettier .",
					},
				}),
			},
			scripts: ["npm run format -- --write"],
		};
	},
});
```

If you don't want to configure a formatter for users, you can instead use a synchronous API from the formatter on all created files.
This template uses [`@prettier/sync`](https://npmjs.com/package/@prettier/sync) to format a few files:

```ts
import { format } from "@prettier/sync";
import { createTemplate } from "bingo";

export default createTemplate({
	about: { name: "My Template" },
	produce() {
		return {
			files: {
				"README.md": format(`# Hello, world!`, { parser: "md" }),
				"index.js": format(`console.log("Hello, world!");`, { parser: "js" }),
				"package.json": format(
					JSON.stringify({
						// ...
					}),
					{ parser: "json" },
				),
			},
		};
	},
});
```
