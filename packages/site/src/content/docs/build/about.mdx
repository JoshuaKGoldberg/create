So you'd like to build a repository template with Bingo.
Wonderful!

Here are the main concepts you'll want to understand:

1. **[Templates](/build/concepts/templates)**: describing how to setup or transition a repository given a set of options
2. **[Creations](/build/concepts/creations)**: how the pieces of a repository are described by templates in-memory
3. **[Inputs](/build/concepts/inputs)**: the recommended way for inferring default option values from system resources

Bingo is still early stage.
It runs well but its APIs are still in flux.
Please try it out and report any issues on GitHub! üôè
